* General
	* Purpose: study monkey V1V2V4, and connectivity by laser
	* Date: 20161129
	* Location: ZIINT 106
	* People: Anna, Song, Xu Guohua, Du Xiao, Li Zheming, Wang Qiannan, Qian Meizhen.
	* Planed Experiment: visual stimulus, laser experiment
	* Brain window: left foveal cortex
	* alga: 4% american alga.
	* ring illumination
	* FOV for run01 - run 11: 17.5 * 14.4 mm.
	* screen distance: 57 cm.


* Animal treatment
	* monkey (big fat)
	* window: V1V2V4

* Run00
	* Animal: heart rate 180; co2: 4.1; temp: 38.5; o2: 100
	* Input: 2 eyes, 4 orientation
		* conditions: 13 conditions; eyes (L, R, both) x 4 orientations = 12 conditions, +blank; drift grating;
		* drift grating: SP: 3 cycles/degree. Temporal frequency: 1 cycles/second
		* stim timing: 0-frame: 2 frames, 0.5s; visual stim 3.5s; interstim: 8s
	* Output: big FOV
		* Camera: Back 50 x Front 105
	* Result: FOV too big
		* OD is clear
		* one area is not clear
		* run for 10 trials.
		* consider changing the camera and FOV.

* Change camera to back 50 x front 85. FOV: 17.5 * 14.4 mm

* Run01
	* Animal: heart rate 176; co2: 4.1; temp: 38.8; o2: 100
	* input: same as run00
	* output: smaller FOV
		* Camera: Back 50 x front 85
	* Result: clear OD
		* plan to change SF.


* Run02
	* Animal: heart rate 165; co2: 4.0; temp: 38.8; o2: 100;
		* try to cool the animal temperature
	* Input: change SF to 1.5 cycles/degree. change white color from [0.5 0.5 0.5] to [1 1 1], to get higher contrast.
	* output: camera setting remain the same as run01
	* Result: clear OD	
		* plan to do laser next.	

* we destroyed alga during installation of laser tip and camera.
* we changed alga.

* Run03: laser experiment
	* Input: laser pulse train: 200hz, 0.5J/cm2, Number pulses: 100, duration of each train: 0.5s.
	* output camera setting remain the same as run01.
	* Result:
		* 10 trails.
		* found light too strong after 10 trials.

* move camera position
* Run04: laser experiment
	* Animal: heart rate 180; co2: 4.0; temp: 38.3; o2: 100;
 	* Input: same as run03
	* output: same as run03
	* Result: 20 trails
		* light still too strong

* turn the red light weaker

* Run05: laser experiment
	* Animal: heart rate 181; co2: 4.0; temp: 38.3; o2: 100;
	* Input: same as run04
	* output: same as run04
	* result: 40 trails

* Run06: laser experiment
	* Input: change laser power to 0.3J/cm2. Frequency remains the same. without visual stimulus.

* put a visual stimulus of 4 orientation, open left eye.
* turned on isoflurane to 0.5.

* Run07: same as run06. maybe need to redo. because isoflurane is on.
	* Input: laser power: 0.3J/cm2. Frequency: 200 hz. with drift grating on left eye.


* Run08:
	* Input: laser power: 0.1J/cm2. Frequency: 200 Hz. With drift grating on left eye.

* Run09:
	* Input: laser power: 0.1J/cm2. Frequency: 200 Hz. without drift grating.

* Run10:
	* Input: laser power: 0.5J/cm2. Frequency: 200 Hz. with drift grating on left eye.
	
* Run11:
	* Purpose: redo run07. Now isoflurane is 0.
	* Input: laser power: 0.3J/cm2. Frequency: 200 Hz. with drift grating on left eye.

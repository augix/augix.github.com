animal: chose most aggressive cat.

window center: L4P4
size: 8mm x 10mm (left-right 8mm)

first heart rate record: 220 

start at 1pm.
run00: 17/18 border
	* my stim
	* grating for area 17 (g17)
	* grating for area 18
	* image not clear.
	* respiration abnormal.

change screen height and camera f-stop.

run01: 17/18 border
	* my stim
	* heart rate: 166; co2: 4.4; temp: 37.4
	* see good response, run for 10 trials.


run02: 17/18 border
	* song's new stim: velocity=2
	* modified frame range to 11-15, removed frame-0 subtraction.

run03: 17/18 border
	* song's old stim velocity=1
	* this parameter is not good. border not clear.

run04: 17/18 test 2 TFs 
	* SF1=SF2= 0.4; velocity1=3, velocity2=7
	* 

put laser on spot #1 in area 17. It is very close to the border.

laser is always 200Hz.

run05: laser at spot #1
	* 0.5J/cm2
	* saw clear 2 spots of activation

run06
	* change to 0.3J/cm2
	* for same trials, see 2 spots of activation

run07
	* change to 0.7J/cm2

put laser on spot #2 in area 17.	
	* spot #2 that is more posterior than spot #1; 
run08
	* 0.3J/cm2

run09
	* 0.5J/cm2

put laser on spot #3 at the area 18.

run10
	* 0.3J/cm2

run11
	* 0.5J/cm2

run12
	* 0.7J/cm2

put laser on spot #4 at the area 21.

run13
	* 0.3J/cm2

run14
	* 0.5J/cm2

move laser tip inward closer to the sulcurs.

run15
	* 0.5J/cm2
	* we found bubble at the laser tip, but wanna have 5 trials to check if that doesnt matter.
	* the image looks bad.

put laser again at the same place.

run16
	* 0.5J/cm2

run17
	* 0.7J/cm2
	* image quality too bad, suspect that the alga went bad.




What I learned?
	* have to take photo of laser tip.
	* always have next step in mind.
	* whenever there is good result from online map, have to decide

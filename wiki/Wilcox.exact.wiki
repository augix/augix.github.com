= Usage =
<R>
     ## Default S3 method:
     wilcox.exact(x, y = NULL, alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
                  mu = 0, paired = FALSE, exact = NULL,  
                  conf.int = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95, ...)
     ## S3 method for class 'formula':
     wilcox.exact(formula, data, subset, na.action, ...)

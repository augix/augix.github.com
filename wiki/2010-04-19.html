Nature Reviews Genetics 11, 317 (May 2010)  Research Highlight
</p>

<p>
Two groups of researchers sequenced mRNA from lymphobalastoid cell lines derived from about 60 individuals that have been extensively genotyped as part of the HapMap project.
</p>

<p>
They found a greater number of statistically significant eQTLs than had been identified by microarray studies. Both studies agree with previous studies which found that most eQTLs lie close to gene transcriptional start sites or in the 3'UTR.
</p>

<p>
These studies were able to show directly that eQTLs modulate expression in <i>cis</i>.

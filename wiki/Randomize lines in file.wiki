There are many ways in Bash in randomizing lines in a file.

{{{class="brush: bash" 

$ shuf origin.txt > randomized.txt

$ sort -R origin.txt > randomized.txt

$ cat -n origin.txt | sort -R | cut -f 2-

$ for i in `cat origin.txt`; do echo "$RANDOM $i"; done | sort | sed -r
's/^[0-9]+ //' > randomized.txt 

}}}

sort -R will only work if the lines are unique.

shuf on the other hand will sufficiently randomize a list, including NOT
putting duplicate lines next to each other. [http://hivearchive.com/2007/10/18/bash-one-liner-to-randomize-lines-in-file/ Reference]

In R, one can perform a Principle component analysis with function named "prcomp" or "princomp".

{{{class="brush: r"
## The variances of the variables in the
## USArrests data vary by orders of magnitude, so scaling is appropriate
(pc.cr <- princomp(USArrests))  # inappropriate
princomp(USArrests, cor = TRUE) # =^= prcomp(USArrests, scale=TRUE)
## Similar, but different:
## The standard deviations differ by a factor of sqrt(49/50)
}}}

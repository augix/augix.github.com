= Usage =
{{{class="brush: bash"
ln source_file hardlink
ln -s source_file symlink
}}}

= Difference between symbolic and hard links =

* Hard link can only be created for a file.
* Symbolic link can link to a directory (folder).
* If you remove the hard link or the symlink itself, the source file will stay intact.
* Removing the source file that your hard link points to does not remove the hardlink itself; the hardlink still provides the content of the underlying file.
* Removing the source file does not remove the attached symbolic link or symlink, but without the source file, the symlink is useless (the same concept like Windows shortcut).

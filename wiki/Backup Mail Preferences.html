<ul>
<li>
Create a uniquely-named folder on your desktop (or other favorite location). For example, you might call it "Mail Prefs Backups May_15_2005" (adding a date is a good idea).

<li>
Quit Mail if it's running.

<li>
In the Finder choose Home from the Go menu.

<li>
Open the Library folder.

<li>
Open the Preferences folder.

<li>
Copy the "com.apple.mail.plist" file to the folder you made in step 1 by Option-dragging the file. Don't remove the original file from its current location (this file contains your Mail accounts information).

<li>
Close the Preferences folder.

<li>
Open the Mail folder.

<li>
Copy the "MessageRules.plist" file to the folder you made in step 1 by Option-dragging the file (this file contains your Mail rules).

<li>
Copy the "SmartMailboxes.plist" file to the folder you made in step 1 by Option-dragging the file (you guessed it, this file contains Smart Mailboxes information).

<li>
Finally, copy the Signatures folder to the folder you made in step 1 by Option-dragging the folder. (Your custom signatures, if you use them, are stored here.)

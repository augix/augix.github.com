eg: 
 Query=  378.txt WGF.0.8  gi|15228342
 GO:0004023  GO:0005507   GO:0006445

In fact, 1 "gi" corresponds 1 or 1 or multiple "go". so you can use a hash of arrays when you want to look up each array (a bunch of "go" record) by the particular string (gi record) rather than merely by an index number. eg:

<perl>
%hash = (
        "gi|15228342" => [ "GO:0004023", "GO:0005507", "GO:0006445"],
);
</perl>

to access and print a hash of arrays.  just follow this code below:

<perl>
foreach $gi( keys %hash ) {
        print "$gi\n @{ $hash{$gi} }\n";
}
</perl>

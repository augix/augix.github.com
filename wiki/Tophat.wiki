= Multiple hits =
There is an option called `-g/--max-multihits <int>`, it instructs TopHat to allow up to this many alignments to the reference for a given read, and suppresses *all alignments* for reads with more than this many alignments.

= Calculate MAPQ =
This is the formule Tophat used for MAPQ calculation. i is the number of hits, m is the MAPQ score. This formule is found in tophat source code tophat_reports.cpp.
{{{
	int mapQ=255;
	if (grade.num_alignments > 1)  {
        double err_prob = 1 - (1.0 / grade.num_alignments);
        mapQ = (int)(-10.0 * log(err_prob) / log(10.0));
    }
    # grad.num_alignments is the number of equally best hits
}}}

so: 
255 = unique mapping

3 = maps to 2 locations in the target

2 = maps to 3 locations

1 = maps to 4-9 locations

0 = maps to 10 or more locations.

But in reality, tophat report 1 for 3-location mapping.

= Multiple hits =
There is an option called `-g/--max-multihits <int>`, it instructs TopHat to allow up to this many alignments to the reference for a given read, and suppresses *all alignments* for reads with more than this many alignments.


= Calculate MAPQ =
This is the formule Tophat used for MAPQ calculation. i is the number of hits, m is the MAPQ score. This formule is found in tophat source code tophat_reports.cpp.

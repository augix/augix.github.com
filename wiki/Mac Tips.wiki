<b>How to Move home directory to another volume of hard disk?</b>

Only 1 lines of commands can finish this task, after the moving, every program works fine with files in the new directory.

If the user name is augix, we want to move augix' home directory /Users/augix/ to another place, for example move to /Volumes/ExternalDisk/.

We just need to open Terminal, and type:

{{{class="brush: bash"
sudo niutil -createprop / /Users/augix home /Volumes/ExternalDisk/augix
}}}

Done, changes made, all you need to do is logging in and delete the original directory.

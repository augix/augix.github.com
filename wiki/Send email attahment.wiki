I usually use "mail" for sending plain emails and "mutt" for sending attachments.
{{{class="brush: bash"
echo "This is a message" | mail -s "Subject" foo@bar.com
}}}

{{{class="brush: bash"
echo "This is a message w/ attachment" | mutt -a file.gz -s "Subject" foo@bar.com
}}}

Select whatever you like, each of the belowing does more or less what you want:
{{{class="brush: bash"
metasend -t you@to.tld -s metasend -f yourfile -b -m text/plain -e base64
pine you@to.tld -attach file -I^X
elm -s ok you@to.tld -A y 
echo `cat yourfile`| mutt -a y -s mutt you@to.tld
echo "attached file: xxx.txt"|uuenview -b -a -m you@to.tld -s subjet xxx.txt
mpack -s "file" yourfile you@to.tld
}}}

Another example from: http://www.simplehelp.net/2008/12/01/how-to-send-email-from-the-linux-command-line/#2gQlzZyDAtBCvzhd.99 
{{{
And if you want mail to read the content from a file:
# mail -s “Hello world” you@youremailid.com < /home/calvin/application.log
Some other useful options in the mail command are:
-s subject (The subject of the mail)
-c email-address (Mark a copy to this “email-address”, or CC)
-b email-address (Mark a blind carbon copy to this “email-address”, or BCC)
Here’s how you might use these options:
# echo “Welcome to the world of Calvin n Hobbes” | mail -s “Hello world” calvin@cnh.com -c hobbes@cnh.com -b susie.derkins@cnh.com

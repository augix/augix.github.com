<h1 id="toc_1">Date</h1>
<p>
Date is one of those quit essential Unix utilities that perform a single simple task, and perform it well. I was familiar with date having used before it find the time:
 $ date 
 Tue Sep 26 22:14:34 EDT 2000
</p>

<p>
 $ date +%d%b
 26Sep
</p>

<p>
 $ date +%d%b%Y
 26Sep2007
</p>

<ol>
<li>
create a new file named 26Sep.bak
 $ touch <code>date +%d%b</code>.bak

</ol>

<h1 id="toc_2">Tar</h1>

<p>
 $ tar cf - /Users/augix/Documents/ &gt; /backup/Documents.<code>date +%d%b</code>.tar
</p>

<p>
The 'c' tells tar to create an archive, the 'f' alerts tar to the source of the input, and the '-' (hyphen) causes tar to store the archive on standard output, which is then redirected to the file,  /backup/Documents.<code>date +%d%b</code>.tar.
</p>

<h1 id="toc_3">Gzip</h1>
<p>
I wanted desperately to gzip (compress) the archive immediately after I tarred it. I knew that I could use tar's 'z' option, both when compressing and uncompressing, but using it gave me an error about garbage at the end of the tar file (which bothered me), and I really wanted to maximally compress the archive using "gzip -9". 
</p>

<p>
 $ tar cf - /Users/augix/Documents/ &gt; /backup/Documents.<code>date +%d%b</code>.tar
 $ gzip -9 /backup/Documents.<code>date +%d%b</code>.tar
</p>

<h1 id="toc_4">Find</h1>
<p>
Now that I figured out the steps necessary for creating a weekly backup of the entire fileshare, I needed to figure out how to backup only those files that had changed in the last day, on a daily basis. 
</p>

<p>
 $ find /Users/augix/Documents/ -mtime -1 
</p>

<p>
the command lists both the files that were modified as well as the directories that contain them. I figured out that in order to limit the list to files only, I could use:
</p>

<p>
 $ find /export/samba/fileshare/ -mtime -1 \! -type d
</p>
<ol>
<li>
where the "\! â€“ type d" means: "don't include directories."

</ol>

<h1 id="toc_5">Combine these commands</h1>
<p>
 $ tar cf - <code>find /Users/augix/Documents/ -mtime -1 \! -type d</code> &gt; /backup/Documents.<code>date +%d%b</code>.tar
</p>

<p>
But the line above does not work for the files with space in their names. So, the correct command is:
</p>

<p>
 $ find /Users/augix/Documents/ -mtime -1 \! -type d &gt; /tmp/modified.files
 $ tar cT /tmp/modified.files &gt; /backup/Documents.<code>date +%d%b</code>.tar
 $ gzip -9 /backup/Documents.<code>date +%d%b</code>.tar
</p>

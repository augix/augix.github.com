If received an error message, one can use taceback function to find out in which function the bug is:

{{{
> traceback()
}}}

After located the specific function, one can use debug funtion to find the specific line of code containing bug. For example, the function name is SS.

{{{
> debug(SS)
> SS(2, x)

Browser[1]>
}}}

One is now in what is called the "browser". Here one can enter 1 of 4 basic debug commands (n, c, where, Q).

{{{
n 
    executes the current line and prints the next one. 
c
    executes the rest of the function without stopping and causes the function to return. 
    This is useful if you are done debugging in the middle of a function and don't want 
    to step throught the rest of the lines. 
Q 
    quits debugging and completely halts execution of the function. 
where
    you can type where to show where you are in the function call stack.
}}}

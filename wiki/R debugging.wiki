If received an error message, one can use taceback function to find out in
which function the bug is:

{{{class="brush: r"
> traceback()
}}}

After located the specific function, one can use debug funtion to find the
specific line of code containing bug. For example, the function name is SS.

{{{class="brush: r"
> debug(SS)
> SS(2, x)

Browser[1]>
}}}

One is now in what is called the "browser". Here one can enter 1 of 4 basic
debug commands (n, c, where, Q).

{{{class="brush: text"
<Enter>
    Go to the next statement if the function is being debugged. Continue
    execution if the browser was invoked.

c or cont
    Continue execution without single stepping.

n
    Execute the next statement in the function. This works from the browser as
    well.

where
    Show the call stack.

Q
    Halt execution and jump to the top-level immediately.  To view the value of
    a variable whose name matches one of these commands, use the print()
    function, e.g. print(n).
}}}

One can use debug(the_2nd_level_function) to go deeper.

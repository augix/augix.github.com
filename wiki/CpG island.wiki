CpG islands are often located around the promoters of housekeeping genes
(which are essential for general cell functions) or other genes frequently
expressed in a cell.  At these locations, the CG sequence is not methylated. 
By contrast, the CG sequences in inactive genes are usually methylated to suppress
their expression.  The methylated cytosine may be converted to thymine by
accidental deamination.  Unlike the cytosine to uracil mutation which is
efficiently repaired, the cytosine to thymine mutation can be corrected only by
the mismatch repair which is very inefficient.  Hence, over evolutionary time scales, the
methylated CG sequence will be converted to the TG sequence.  This explains
the deficiency of the CG sequence in inactive genes.

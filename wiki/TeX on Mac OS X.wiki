= Introducation =
To use TeX on Mac OS X, it suffices to install TeXShop and one of BasicTeX, gwTeX, or TeXLive-2007-Dev. For a more complete installation, install MacTeX-2007, but then upgrade TeXShop to the latest version.

= Installation =
== gwTeX ==
# I installed gwTeX by i-installer. [http://ii2.sourceforge.net/tex-index.html Link].
## I download and install II2.dmg, 
## and then install "gwTeX based on TeX Live" in /usr/local/gwTeX, this will also install xelatex in /usr/texbin/ which can be used by TeXShop
# Install [http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/ TeXShop]

== BasicTeX ==

= How to put references into an article =
Assume that we have an article named <tt>DNA.tex</tt> written in Tex, and an file named <tt>DNA.bib</tt> which exported by a reference manage software (eg: BibDesk). The citations you inserted in the article correspond to the papers in the reference file.

What we can do by TeXShop is following:
# latex DNA.tex
#:This produce DNA.aux
# bibtex DNA.aux (or DNA.tex)
#:This produce DNA.bbl and DNA.blg
# latex DNA.tex two more times.
#:Finally you get DNA.pdf

We can also do it in terminal:
{{{
pdflatex DNA.tex
bibtex DNA.aux
pdflatex DNA.tex
pdflatex DNA.tex
}}}

= Commands =
attributes, attr, class, methods, UseMethod, getAnywhere

{{{
attributes
    Print attributes of an object.
    
attr
    change attributes of an object.

class
    change class of an object.
    
methods
    Print methods in a generic function.

UseMethod
    Constructing a generic function.
    GF <- function(x, ...) UseMethod('GF')
    
getAnywhere
    find a function
}}}

= Golden rule =
* eveything is an object, a vector
* DO NOT call methods directly, instead use a generic function, which dispatches methods to objects according to their classes.

= Concepts =
* Inheritance: A way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined.
{{{
class(x) = c('newClass', class(x))
}}}

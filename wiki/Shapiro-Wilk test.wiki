In [[statistics]], the <b>Shapiro-Wilk test</b> tests the [[null hypothesis]] that a [[statistical sample|sample]] x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub> came from a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] population. It was published in 1965 by [[Samuel Shapiro (statistician)|Samuel Shapiro]] and [[Martin Wilk]].

In R, one does the Shapiro-Wilk test with command:
{{{class="brush: r"
shapiro.test(x)
}}}

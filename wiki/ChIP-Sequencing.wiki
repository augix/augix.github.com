'''ChIP-Sequencing''', also known as '''ChIP-Seq''', is used to analyze protein interactions with DNA. ChIP-Seq combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to identify the [[cistrome]] of DNA-associated proteins. It can be used to precisely map global binding sites for any protein of interest.

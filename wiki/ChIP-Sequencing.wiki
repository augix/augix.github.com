<b>ChIP-Sequencing</b>, also known as <b>ChIP-Seq</b>, is used to analyze protein interactions with DNA. ChIP-Seq combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to identify the [[cistrome]] of DNA-associated proteins. It can be used to precisely map global binding sites for any protein of interest.

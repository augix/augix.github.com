== 随机变量 expected value ==

In probability theory and statistics, the expected value (or expectation value, or mathematical expectation, or mean, or first moment) of a random variable is the integral of the random variable with respect to its probability measure.

The expected value operator (or <b>expectation operator</b>) is linear.

== 方差 variance, deviation ==

In probability theory and statistics, the variance of a random variable or distribution is the expected, or mean, value of the square of the deviation of that variable from its expected value or mean.

== other ==
协方差 covariance，相关系数 correlation coefficient. If two random variables are independent, their covariance equals to 0.

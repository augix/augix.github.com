* Python dictionary can only use immutable elements as keys, therefore list can not be used as keys, but tuples with immutable elements can.

* create dictionary
{{{
l = dict(a=1,b=2,c=3)
l = dict(zip(['a','b','c'],[1,2,3]))
dict(zip('abc',[1,2,3]))
}}}

* Iterating Through a Dictionary
{{{class="brush: python"
>>> import os
>>> for k, v in os.environ.items():     
...     print "%s=%s" % (k, v)
}}}


* Double dictionary
reference: [http://desk.stinkpot.org:8080/tricks/index.php/2006/04/create-a-double-dictionary-in-python/ create a double dictionary in python]

the following WON'T work
{{{class="brush: python"
>>> x = dict()
>>> x[1][1] = “foo”
}}}
instead, one can use this:
{{{class="brush: python"
>>> x = dict()
>>> x[1,1] = “foo”
}}}

note that, tuple (1,1) is used as key.


* find the key to the max and min value
suppose d is the dict.
{{{class="brush: python"
max(d,key = lambda a: d.get(a))
}}}

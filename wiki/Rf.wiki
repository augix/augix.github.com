R as unix filter

`Rf' allows unix script programmers to use the statistics program `R' as a proper unix filter.

Basically, Rf allows you to write a little sh-bang script (included in this distribution as file `mean'):

{{{class="brush: bash"
#!/usr/local/bin/Rf

x <- scan(.stdin, quiet=T) 
cat (mean(x))
}}}

This example script reads number in from stdin (the R character variable `.stdin') and prints the average on standard out. Thus, one could say on the command line:

{{
$ seq 10 | mean
}}}



= Installation =

This first version assumes the following:

{{
* `r-as-filter' installed in /usr/local/lib
* `Rf' installed in /usr/local/bin
}}}

Note that you may install Rf anywhere, but if you want to use it in
shbang context (first line of `executable R script' starting with
/usr/local/bin/Rf) then this should be a consistent location in order
to make it more portable.  

If you can't copy to /usr/local/lib, change the destination in
`Rf.c'. 

Make `Rf' by typing

{{
$ make Rf
}}}

And then copy
{{
$ install Rf /usr/local/bin
$ install r-as-filter /usr/local/lib
}}}

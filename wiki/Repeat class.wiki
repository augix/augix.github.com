Repeats can be categorized as 3 major categories:
Terminal repeats, Tandem repeats & Interspersed repeats

* Terminal repeats
    * also called Long terminal repeats (LTRs)
    * they are identical sequences of DNA that *repeat hundreds or thousands of times* found at either *end of retrotransposons* or proviral DNA formed by reverse transcription of retroviral RNA[citation needed]. They are used by viruses to insert their genetic material into the host genomes.
* Tandemly repeated DNA
    * definition: copies lie adjacent to each other, directly or inverted
    * subtypes: satellite DNA, minisatellite, microsatellite
	* often associated with disease syndromes
	* Telomeres
		* Contain long arrays of TTAGGG repeats
		* Repeats form nucleoprotein complex: Associate with TERF proteins  
		* Repeat function
* Interspersed repetitive DNA (seems also called transposable elements)
	* DNA Transposons: does not involve an RNA intermediate
	* retroposons
	    * LTR-retrotransposons: with long terminal repeats
	    * non LTR-retrotransposons: without
            * Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs)
                * Alu
                * Mariner (Mariner-like) elements
            * Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs): e.g.: L1
* Other types: direct repeats, inverted repeats

= Genome Browser =
* Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE), which include ALUs
* Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE)
* Long terminal repeat elements (LTR), which include retroposons
* DNA repeat elements (DNA)
* Simple repeats (micro-satellites)
* Low complexity repeats
* Satellite repeats
* RNA repeats (including RNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNA, scRNA, srpRNA)
* Other repeats, which includes class RC (Rolling Circle)
* Unknown

= DNA Repeat types =
DNA Repeat types: Tandemly repeated DNA & Interspersed repetitive DNA
*Tandemly repeated DNA
	*Repeats often associated with disease syndromes
	*Telomeres
		*Contain long arrays of TTAGGG repeats
		*Repeats form nucleoprotein complex: Associate with TERF proteins  
		*Repeat function
*Interspersed repetitive DNA
	*Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs)
		*Alu
		*Mariner (Mariner-like) elements
	*Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs)
	*Transposable elements with Long Terminal Repeats
	*DNA Transposons
*Transposable repeat elements: Possible adverse effects
